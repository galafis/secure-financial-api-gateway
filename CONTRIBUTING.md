docker-compose up --build
```

## 🔧 Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
2. **Make your changes**: Follow the coding standards below
3. **Test your changes**: Ensure all tests pass
4. **Commit your changes**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow existing test patterns

Example:
```python
def test_feature_works_correctly():
    """Test that the feature works as expected"""
    # Arrange
    expected_result = "success"
    
    # Act
    result = my_function()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```
