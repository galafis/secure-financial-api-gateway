| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the maintainer:
- Email: [Your contact email - update this]
- Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue**: e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the issue
3. **Location of the affected source code**: tag/branch/commit or direct URL
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact of the issue**: what can an attacker do with this vulnerability
7. **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report submission
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and estimated timeline
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues fixed within 30 days, others within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its impact
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We'll release a security patch
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

When using this API Gateway, please ensure:

1. **Strong Secrets**: Use strong, random JWT secret keys (at least 32 characters)
2. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
4. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits for your use case
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
6. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
7. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
8. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data
9. **Access Control**: Implement proper role-based access control
10. **Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are enabled

## Known Security Considerations

### JWT Security
- Tokens are signed but not encrypted (use HTTPS to protect in transit)
- Refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client
- Token rotation is recommended for long-lived sessions

### Rate Limiting
- Per-IP rate limiting can be bypassed by rotating IPs
- Consider implementing additional bot protection for public endpoints

### Circuit Breaker
- Circuit breaker states are in-memory (use Redis for distributed systems)
- State is not persisted across restarts

### In-Memory Storage
- The demo uses in-memory storage for users (not suitable for production)
- Replace with a proper database for production deployments

## Security Audits

This project undergoes regular security reviews:
- **Code Review**: Every pull request is reviewed for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning via GitHub Actions
- **Static Analysis**: Security static analysis with Bandit
- **Last Security Audit**: [Date] - [Brief findings]

## Acknowledgments

We thank the following security researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities:

- [List will be populated as vulnerabilities are reported and fixed]
